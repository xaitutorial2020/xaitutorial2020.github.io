          <h2 align="center">Overview</h2>
          <p>The future of AI lies in enabling people to collaborate with machines to solve complex problems. Like any efficient collaboration, this requires good communication, trust, clarity and understanding. XAI (eXplainable AI) aims at addressing such challenges by combining the best of symbolic AI and traditional Machine Learning. Such topic has been studied for years by all different communities of AI, with different definitions, evaluation metrics, motivations and results.</p>

          <p>This tutorial is a snapshot on the work of XAI to date, and surveys the work achieved by the AI community with a focus on machine learning and symbolic AI related approaches. We will motivate the needs of XAI in real-world and large-scale applications, while presenting state-of-the-art techniques and best practices. In the first part of the tutorial, we give an introduction to the different aspects of explanations in AI. We then focus the tutorial on two specific approaches: (i) XAI using machine learning and (ii) XAI using a combination of graph-based knowledge representation and machine learning. For both we get into the specifics of the approach, the state of the art and the limitations and research challenges for the next steps. The final part of the tutorial gives an overview of real-world applications of XAI.</p>

        <h2 align="center">Outline</h2>
        <h4>Part I: Introduction and Motivation - 20 minutes</h4>
        <p>Broad-spectrum introduction on explanation in AI. This will include describing and motivating the need for explainable AI techniques, from both theoretical and applicative standpoints. In this part we also summarize the prerequisites, and we introduce the different angles taken by the rest of the tutorial.</p>

        <h4>Part II: Explanation in AI (not only Machine Learning!) - 40 minutes</h4>
        <p>General overview of explanation in various field of AI (optimization, knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning, search and constraint optimization, planning, natural language processing, robotics and vision) to align everyone on the various definitions of explanation. Evaluation of explainability will be also covered. The tutorial will cover most of definitions but will only go deep in the following areas: (i) Explainable Machine Learning, (ii) Explainable AI with Knowledge Graphs and Machine Learning.</p>

        <h4>Part III: Explainable Machine Learning (from a Machine Learning Perspective) - 75 minutes</h4>
        <p>In this section we tackle the broad problem of explainable machine learning pipelines. We describe the notion of explanation in the machine learning community, and we proceed by describing a number of popular techniques, mainly post-hoc explainability, explainability by design, example-based explanations, prototype-based explanations and evaluation of explanations. The core of this section is the analysis of different categories of black box problems, ranging from the black box model explanation, to black box outcome explanation.</p>

        <h4>Part IV: Explainable Machine Learning (from a Knowledge Graph Perspective) - 60 minutes</h4>
        <p> In this section of the tutorial we address the explanatory power of combining graph-based knowledge bases with machine learning approaches. </p>

        <h4>Part V: XAI Tools on Applications, Lessons Learnt and Research Challenges - 120 minutes</h4>
        <p>We will review some XAI open source and commercial tools applied in real-world examples. We focus on a number of use cases: i) explaining obstacle detection for autonomous trains; ii) an interpretable flight delay prediction system, with built-in explanation capabilities; iii) a wide-scale contract management system that predicts and explains the risk tier of corporate projects with semantic reasoning over knowledge graphs; iv) an expenses system that identifies, explains, and predict abnormal expense claims by employees of large organizations in 500+ cities; v) explanations of search and recommendation systems; vi) explaining sales predictions; vii) explaining lending decisions; viii) explaining fraud detection.</p>
